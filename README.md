# Russian Equipment Losses (WarSpotting API Data Extractor)

This Python script downloads and saves documented Russian equipment losses from the open-source [WarSpotting.net](https://ukr.warspotting.net) API into an Excel file for further analysis and research.

---

## Features

* Fetches equipment loss data for each day from February 24, 2022 onward
* Based on **WarSpotting.net's official API**
* Outputs data into a structured `.xlsx` (Excel) file
* Includes type, model, location, unit (if known), etc...

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations & Disclaimers

* ‚ö†Ô∏è Due to API limitations, the script retrieves a maximum of 100 records per day
  ‚Üí This does not significantly affect analytical value but should be noted.
* Only Russian losses** are accessible through the API; Ukrainian data is not available
* The script includes polite delays between each request to prevent overloading the API
* Built entirely on WarSpotting.net‚Äôs public API ‚Äì credit to them for maintaining this invaluable source
* üß™ This project is for **research and educational purposes only**

## How It Works

1. You set a date range
2. The script queries the WarSpotting API one day at a time
3. For each day, it downloads up to 100 loss records
4. Adds a delay between each request to respect the API's limits
5. Saves the result to `warspotting_losses.xlsx` with all relevant data
